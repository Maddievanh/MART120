        <h1>The story of Dudley the dragon</h1>
        <p>Once upon a time, there was a dragon named Dudley</p>
        <p>He found some children in the woods eating berries</p>
        <p>They were super scared at first, but became best friends</p>
        <p>They ate many berries together and walked around the forest all day long</p>
        <p>Dudley took the children in because they had no home</p>
        <p>And they lived happily ever after eating berries in the forest together</p>
